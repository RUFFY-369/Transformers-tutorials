# Iris Model notebook

IRIS (Imagination with auto-Regression over an Inner Speech) is a Reinforcement learning agent trained in the imagination of a world model composed of a discrete autoencoder and an autoregressive Transformer. IRIS learns behaviors by accurately simulating millions of trajectories.

This folder contains demo notebook to train IRIS agent on Atari environment of choice. By default the choice of environment is `BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4`

There is also a [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@cedric.vandelaer/paper-review-transformers-are-sample-efficient-world-models-d0f9144f9c09) to understand how the algorithm works.
